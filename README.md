after you download the code file GESTION STOCK
run xamp to create database
RUN createtables_insert.py
The code creates a new database called "gestion_stock" and creates a table named "produit" in that database. The "produit" table has columns for product name, description, unit price, stock quantity, and image.

After creating the table, the code inserts 20 products into the "produit" table using a loop. For each product, the code reads an image file, stores the image data as a binary object, and then inserts the product data into the table using an SQL INSERT statement.


after creating the tables
run the python file firstpage.py
